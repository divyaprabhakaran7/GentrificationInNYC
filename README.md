# GentrificationInNYC
Have you ever wondered if your quaint New York City neighborhood was going to be hit next by an increase in rent or an influx of construction machinery? Or what the next trendy, up and coming neighborhood would be in New York City? 

Gentrification has swept over countless neighborhoods in New York City, from Williamsburg to the Lower East Side, resulting in soaring rent prices, more affluent residents, racial transformations, and new construction projects.But what even is gentrification you ask?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines gentrification as “the transformation of neighborhoods from low value to high value.” So, how can we predict what neighborhoods are likely to experience gentrification in the coming years?

Using New York City Neighborhood Data Profiles from New York University’s Furman Center, we will compile data on demographics, income per household, average housing costs, and construction permits in each New York City zip code over the course of several years. With this information along with statistics from previously gentrified neighborhoods, we aim to apply machine learning techniques to build a gentrification predictor so you can see if you should soon be expecting changes to sweep across your New York City neighborhood. We have produced data representations so you can clearly visualize gentrification predictions across New York City neighborhoods.
